# ⛅ 🌈 Open-Weather-Map-API ☀️ ☔

<hr>


Postman was utilized to validate the API endpoints from the weather app, ensuring their functionality and reliability for developers. A series of API calls were executed to thoroughly test their performance, including intentionally attempting to break them to identify potential vulnerabilities. The testing confirmed that the API is robust, well-designed, and meets the required standards.

📝 Test cases provide clear guidance and direction on what to verify and how to conduct the checks. Below is a snippet from the attached Excel spreadsheet.
